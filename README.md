# HI

Learning go, made a thing to generate word scrambles.

Use -h to see command line options, they alter different aspects of the game.

An input json file that contains a list of words needs to be created. The program defaults to words.json
but that can be changed with the -input flag.

Also included a tool to create that file from an arbitrary website.
-h will also show cl options for that. You need python.
